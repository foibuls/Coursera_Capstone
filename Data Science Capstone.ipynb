    "When moving to a new city, it takes some time to get to know the place and get oriented. Particularly in major metropolitan cities, which neighborhood you live in matters quite a lot - each one has its own atmosphere, like a miniature city. How, when moving somewhere for the first time, could you pick a neighborhood? As a solution, I'm proposing a tool to map neighborhoods in one city to the most similar neighborhoods in another. To prove the concept, I will use two major, metropolitan and international cities: San Francisco, USA, and Sydney, AU."

    "For this task, Foursquare data will be essential. The specific data will be all venues in both cities (unless I limit this for speed and proof of concept.) For example, a sample row of Foursquare data that I use would need at minimum the latitude, longitude, name, and category of a venue. I will also need GeoJSON files of Sydney and San Francisco for visualization. Optionally, I'll add in crime data for each city to make the clustering more useful. Here is an example crime dataset for SF. https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/SF-Crime-Heat-Map/q6gg-sa2p\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this data, I will use kmeans clustering and possibly additional clustering to find the neighborhoods most similar to eachother between the two cities. Ideally I'll determine, for each neighborhood in San Francisco, which is the most similar neighborhood in Sydney - and vice-versa. Since this will take some customization of clustering algorithms, I'll instead try and come as close to this as possible by optimizing the standard algorithms in this proof-of-concept."
